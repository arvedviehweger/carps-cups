macOS (Mac OS X) CUPS driver for Canon CARPS printers
====================================

This provides rastertocups filter and PPD files (specified by carps.drv file) which
allows these printers to print from macOS. 

carps-decode is a debug tool - it decodes CARPS data (created either by rastertocups
filter or windows drivers), producing a PBM bitmap and debug output.

This driver has been tested and compiled on macOS 14.7 on an Apple Silicon machine.
If compiled from source it should work on any software version and any architecture (arm/x86).

Printers known to use CARPS data format:

Compiling from source
---------------------
Requirements: make, gcc (Xcode Commandline Tools)

To compile, simply run "make":

    $ make

To install the compiled driver, run:

    $ sudo make install

You can then install the printer using System Preferences.
